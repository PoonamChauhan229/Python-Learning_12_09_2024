Before Going to anything....
Since we are here to learn the python language.

To get started with Python, let's make sure our system is set up properly

>Install Python
>Download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.
>https://www.python.org/downloads/

click on Download Python 3.12.6

While installation(1st screen)
> Check the 2 checkboes which are mention at the bootom
 Install launchers for all users
 Add Python.exe to Path

Once this installations is complete
_____________________________________________________________________________
Open the cmd and check the version
python --version

_____________________________________________________________________________
We can go and download VS code , if not avaialble in system
Thera are IDE code editors (pycharm, anacoda) but we will use vscode itself as many of us are familair with this.

After sucessful installations
install 2 extensions in vscode from marketplace
        >Code Runner v0.12.2 Jun Han
        >Python v2024.14.0 Microsoft microsoft.com
_____________________________________________________________________________
After this close the Vscode and reopen 
Lets Create the first file
>02test.py

just write in the file
> print("Hello World")

 open the terminal
 > python filename

Now, as we dont want to rewrite the python filename again and again
>click the run button
File will get executed

Now, once our sytem is ready...
Now, lets go ahead and understand

WHAT IS PYTHON 

Python is an easy-to-learn and powerful Object-Oriented Programming language. It is a high-level programming language.
____________________________________________________________________________ 

Why Python?
Easy to Use: Python is comparatively an easier-to-use language as compared to other programming languages.
Expressive Language: The syntax of Python is closer to how you would write pseudocode. Which makes it capable of expressing the codeâ€™s purpose better than many other languages.
Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language; this means that the Python installation interprets and executes the code a line at a time.
Python is one of the most popular programming languages to be used in Web Development owing to the variety of Web Development platforms built over it like Django, Flask, etc.

____________________________________________________________________________

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. 

____________________________________________________________________________

Why Python?
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has a syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
 
____________________________________________________________________________

Compare:Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Python was designed for readability and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
