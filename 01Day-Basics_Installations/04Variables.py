# Variables are like containers just like you have in your kitchen In which you store lentils, flour & rice etc

# In Python Programming Language 'Variables' are just like those containers 
# Let's suppose I've a container in my hand 
# And let's suppose this container contains lentils and let's suppose that I replace those lentils with rice
# So basically I just changed the content of this container 

# On the other hand, let's suppose if I take another container And in this container if I put some water and then I put some milk
# So I can change it's content

# This is exactly what happens in Python as well.

# That you people make containers and stores data in them.
# And this data is stored in the memory.
# It is stored in it, what you call 'RAM'

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

# = is an assignment operator
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.


# Rules for Python Variables
'''
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

'''

# Many Values to Multiple Variables
# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# One Value to Multiple Variables
# And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
