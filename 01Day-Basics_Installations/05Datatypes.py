# Datatypes
'''
Just like a container can contain 'Liquid' 'Solid' 'Lentils' or 'Sugar'
Even maybe there is something that is not even edible
We have a lot of items
For eg. liquid dish wash, that liquid is not edible
So there are 'types' of everything
Just like that there are 'Types' in Python which we refer as 'Data Types'
